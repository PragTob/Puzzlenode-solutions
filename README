# My Puzzlenode Solutions
Those are just the solutions of puzzlenode (http://puzzlenode.com/) puzzles I did. Currently there are only two as they were part of the RMU application (http://university.rubymendicant.com/).

# About Testing
I love testing. I love TDD. However I think that the big benefits of testing emerge when working on long running projects, in collaboration with other developers and in documentation.

Puzzlenode puzzles aren't long running projects and I do them ony my own, so in general I just start solving them without writing tests. I might add tests when I feel like I need a quick and automated way to make sure something works or when I want to write some specs just for the fun of it.
