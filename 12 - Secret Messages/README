How to run:
    ruby CombinedCiphers.rb
    
    You may supply an optional file name, default is complex_cipher.txt
    
Notes:
    Solved with Ruby 1.9.2
    
    My Caesar decryption uses a dictionary, I took the dictionary from /usr/share/dict/ of my Linux installation (Linux Mint 10 - it's awesome!). I hope I don't get into licnensing trouble ;-) 
    The dictionary is also supplied in my .zip file.
    
    RepeatingKey could have been done using an enumerator, however there is no "next?" method and I feel uncomfortable frequently catching the exception and calling rewind. 
    However I haven't read "Exceptional Ruby" yet - so my view might change ;-)
    
    I am aborting when the first matching key is found for the Caesar chiffre, as multiple matches didn't occur in the test file. 
    
    Some other comments may be found in code where appropriate. And yes I am a guy who comments a lot (somtetimes too much I guess)
    
Personal Notes:
    I could have taken more time and finish reading Ruby Best Practices first. However in the beginning of August I'll move to Sweden for 8 months in order to start studying my Master's degree in Software Engineering. So I got a lot of things to do and I wanted to enter my application before every place is taken.
    I hope this is close to what you consider idiomatic Ruby, even without defining methods with blocks myself (I didn't see the need to). I still got a lot to learn ;-)
    
    If the code appears to be a bit too Java-ish: I had to write Java for the past eight months every day during the course of my bachelor project. I hope that the damage isn't lasting.
    
    Thank you for running RMU.
