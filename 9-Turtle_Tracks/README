How to run:
    ruby TurtleCombined.rb
    
    You may supply an optional file name, default is complex.logo
    
Notes:
    Solved with Ruby 1.9.2
    
    It was not specified what should happen if the turtle walks out of bounds, so I decided to raise an exception.
    
    For "Direction.for orientation", I am sure there is some mathmatical rule for calculating the direction from the orientation. But the one I found had me end up with nearly as many ifs and less readability, so I decided to drop it and make something plain simple.
    
    Some other comments may be found in code where appropriate. And yes I am a guy who comments a lot (somtetimes too much I guess)
  
Personal Notes:  
    I could have taken more time and finish reading Ruby Best Practices first. However in the beginning of August I'll move to Sweden for 8 months in order to start studying my Master's degree in Software Engineering. So I got a lot of things to do and I wanted to enter my application before every place is taken.
    I hope this is close to what you consider idiomatic Ruby, even without defining methods with blocks myself (I didn't see the need to). I still got a lot to learn ;-)
    
    If the code appears to be a bit too Java-ish: I had to write Java for the past eight months every day during the course of my bachelor project. I hope that the damage isn't lasting.
    
    Thank you for running RMU.
